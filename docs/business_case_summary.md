# Music Metadata Enrichment - Business Case Summary
**AI-Powered Solution for $2.5B+ Uncollected Royalties Problem**

---

## Executive Summary

**Opportunity**: Major gaps exist between public music databases and authoritative industry sources, contributing to billions in uncollected royalties annually.

**Solution**: AI-powered metadata enrichment service leveraging privileged industry data access to improve royalty collection accuracy.

**Validation**: Testing with high-earning client BEAM (Tyshane Thompson) revealed complete absence from major public databases despite Epic Records deal, Warner Chappell publishing, and 7.5M+ streams.

## Market Problem Validated

### Uncollected Royalties Crisis
- **$2.5+ billion** in uncollected royalties globally per year
- **Root Cause**: Inaccurate, incomplete, or missing metadata
- **Industry Pain**: Publishers, PROs, and artists struggle with data fragmentation

### Data Gap Evidence - BEAM Case Study

**Industry Reality:**
- Epic Records recording deal ✓
- Warner Chappell publishing (Warner-Tamerlane/BMI) ✓  
- 7.5M+ career streams ✓
- 437K+ monthly Spotify listeners ✓
- Grammy nominations (Kanye West "Donda", Justin Bieber "Justice") ✓
- Collects "tens of thousands" in royalties ✓

**Public Database Results:**
- **MusicBrainz**: ❌ Wrong artist (German electronic musician)
- **Standard APIs**: ❌ Cannot locate correct artist
- **Expected Gap**: If major label artists missing, imagine independent artists
