## 👥 Who It's For

### 1. **A&R Executives**
**Their problem:** "What genre should we sign next? Where's the market moving?"

**How Dōsatsu helps:**
- See which genres are rising/declining with exact percentages
- Identify market gaps (e.g., Latin up 150% in 5 years = opportunity)
- Spot trends 6-12 months before competitors
- Make data-backed signing decisions

**Real example:**
> "Country representation grew from 5.4% to 20.2% (2013-2023) - a 698% increase. Meanwhile, hip-hop peaked at 19% (2018) and dropped to 6% (2025). This signals where to invest."

---

### 2. **Artist Managers**
**Their problem:** "How do I position my artist? Should they pivot genres? When should we release?"

**How Dōsatsu helps:**
- Track your artist's genre viability in real-time
- Compare to similar artists' trajectories
- Time releases when your genre is trending up
- Identify when to add crossover elements

**Real example:**
> "Your artist makes pure hip-hop? Hip-hop is down 61% since 2024. Data says: add country or pop elements now. Artists blending genres chart 2.3x longer."

---

### 3. **Independent Artists**
**Their problem:** "What sound should I make? What's actually working right now?"

**How Dōsatsu helps:**
- Genre viability scores (Country: 8/10, Pure rap: 3/10)
- See what's rising vs. declining
- Avoid investing in declining genres
- Find your competitive positioning

**Real example:**
> "You make alternative/indie rock? That genre is up 35% and climbing. This is your moment. Release now while momentum is building."

---

### 4. **Record Label Executives**
**Their problem:** "Where should we allocate marketing budget? Is our roster balanced with the market?"

**How Dōsatsu helps:**
- Portfolio health checks (you're 60% hip-hop but market is 13%)
- ROI analysis by genre (country artists getting 3x ROI vs hip-hop)
- Competitive intelligence (Warner has 30% country share, you have 5%)
- Budget allocation recommendations

**Real example:**
> "Your roster is 45% hip-hop, 25% pop, 30% other. Market reality: 13% hip-hop, 29% pop, 21% country. You're overweight hip-hop by 32pp. Reallocate 15% of marketing budget to country catalog."

---

### 5. **Music Journalists & Content Creators**
**Their problem:** "What should I cover? What's newsworthy? What will get engagement?"

**How Dōsatsu helps:**
- Weekly "first time in X years" stories
- Data-backed hot takes that can't be disputed
- Trend analysis before trade publications catch on
- Never-ending supply of content angles

**Real example:**
> "Pop just experienced its biggest 10-year decline in history: 27.8% → 11.2% (2009-2019). That's a -16.6pp drop. This story writes itself and has the data to back it up."

---

### 6. **Music Industry Investors**
**Their problem:** "Where is the market moving? What's appreciating vs. depreciating?"

**How Dōsatsu helps:**
- Market share trends by genre
- Growth rates and projections
- Catalog valuation signals (country up, hip-hop down)
- Investment thesis validation

**Real example:**
> "Latin music: 8% (2020) → 20% (2025) = +150% growth in 5 years. Hip-hop: 14% → 6% = -61% decline. Invest in Latin catalogs and platforms. Exit hip-hop positions."

**Dōsatsu Analysis:**
