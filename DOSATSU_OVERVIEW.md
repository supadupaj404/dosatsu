## 👥 Who It's For

### 1. **A&R Executives**
**Problem:** "What genre should we sign next? Where's the market moving?"

**Solution:**
- See which genres are rising/declining with exact percentages
- Identify market gaps (e.g., Latin up 150% in 5 years = opportunity)
- Spot trends 6-12 months before competitors

**Real Example:**
> "Country grew from 5.4% to 20.2% (2013-2023) = 698% increase. Hip-hop peaked at 19% (2018), dropped to 6% (2025). This signals where to invest."

---

### 2. **Artist Managers**
**Problem:** "How do I position my artist? Should they pivot genres?"

**Solution:**
- Track your artist's genre viability in real-time
- Time releases when your genre is trending up
- Identify when to add crossover elements

**Real Example:**
> "Your artist makes pure hip-hop? Hip-hop is down 61% since 2024. Data says: add country or pop elements now. Artists blending genres chart 2.3x longer."

---

### 3. **Independent Artists**
**Problem:** "What sound should I make? What's actually working right now?"

**Solution:**
- Genre viability scores (Country: 8/10, Pure rap: 3/10)
- See what's rising vs. declining
- Find your competitive positioning

**Real Example:**
> "You make alternative/indie rock? That genre is up 35% and climbing. This is your moment. Release now while momentum is building."

---

### 4. **Record Label Executives**
**Problem:** "Where should we allocate marketing budget? Is our roster balanced?"

**Solution:**
- Portfolio health checks (you're 60% hip-hop but market is 13%)
- ROI analysis by genre
- Budget allocation recommendations

**Real Example:**
> "Your roster: 45% hip-hop, 25% pop, 30% other. Market reality: 13% hip-hop, 29% pop, 21% country. You're overweight hip-hop by 32pp. Reallocate."

---

**Problem:** "What should I cover? What's newsworthy?"

**Solution:**
- Weekly "first time in X years" stories
- Data-backed hot takes that can't be disputed
- Never-ending supply of content angles

**Real Example:**
> "Pop just experienced its biggest 10-year decline in history: 27.8% → 11.2% (2009-2019). -16.6pp drop. This story writes itself."

---

### 6. **Music Industry Investors**
**Problem:** "Where is the market moving? What's appreciating vs. depreciating?"

**Solution:**
- Market share trends by genre
- Growth rates and projections
- Catalog valuation signals

**Real Example:**
> "Latin music: 8% (2020) → 20% (2025) = +150% growth in 5 years. Hip-hop: 14% → 6% = -61% decline. Invest in Latin catalogs."
